# LostAnd Found
A website hosted on IPFS with the sole purpose of connecting a person who lost their items and the one who found them.
Both the victim and founder are granted access to post the lost and found items respectively.
Between them exist the service provider who plays the sole role in matching the lost items with the found items and contacting both victim and founder
But the victim will have to pay for the service after being assured that found item(s) belongs to them and then gets them back
